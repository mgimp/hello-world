Practice repository for learning  github processes

This is an exercise for learning branching in github.
When you create a branch, you copy the current state of 'main' or its equivalent.
You can then make edits or 'commits' to the branch files (like what I'm doing by typing this) without altering the files in 'main'.
Once satisfied with the changes in the branch, you can merge them with 'main'.
